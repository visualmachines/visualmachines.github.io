            We give the gift of sight to machines. We do this by building computational imaging systems that tightly couple computer algorithms (CS) and imaging hardware (ECE). If successful, computational imaging has the potential to unleash an era of superhuman robotics.

            A computational imaging system tightly integrates software
            processing and optical capture to form novel imagery. Our group
            builds computational imaging systems that can see through scattering
            media, around corners, and more. We study visual constructs like
            light fields, time of flight imaging, polarization, and coherent
            optics. These constructs are parsed using signal processing and
            numerical methods. ECE 239 is a new UCLA course that covers the
            nascent field of computational imaging

            In an approach we call “computational robotic imaging”, we generalize
            pillar I to a co-design of algorithms, optics and robotics. Inspired
            by the diversity of animal eyes, we believe that vision systems will
            evolve with the needs of robots. Imagine if a self-driving car had a
            vision system that could see obstacles before it turned a corner.

          <p class="body">
            With an expertise in algorithms and optics, we build imaging systems
            for healthcare applications. Imagine the possibility of imaging
            through scattering media, like biological tissue. Ordinarily one has
            had to use X-rays or MRI. However, it might be possible to use novel
            optical and computational methods, like speckle or transient inversion
            to see deeper through the skin. The method at right is able to see
            deep subsurface veins (to identify blood clots), using spatially coded
            visible light. Imagine if similar techniques could be used as a
            low-cost, high throughput screening method for cancers.
